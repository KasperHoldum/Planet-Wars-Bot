All out attack

Defence
	* Future production from planets needs to be taken into consideration in the defensive algorithm

Routing
	* Attack and routing orders might need to be broken down to several orders with shorter distance each.
		This way ships won't travel from one end of the map to the other render them useless meanwhile.

		There are several approaches that can be used to break down orders into shorter paths:
			- A* (advanced)
				http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=894
			- Hops (simple)
				hop(a, b)
					for ( 0 -> maxDeviation) 
					for (planet c = 0 -> planetCount)
					if (dist(a,c) + dist(b,c) <= (dist(a,b) + maxDeviation)) return c
Turn 1:
	* (might) need specialized algorithm

Attack
	Should be more willing to conquer neutral planets
