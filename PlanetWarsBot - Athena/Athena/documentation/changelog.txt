Change log

08-01-2010 Version 1.5
----------------------
 * Turn 1
 * During increase of production algorithm we never target planets closer or equal distance to the enemy start planets than ours.
 * Fixed battle resolution algorithm (specifically: 3 force resolution)
 * Routing now happens before attacking
 * Routing now happens to future owned planets

31-10-2010 Version 1.4
--------------
 * The class Oracle created to handle all predictions
	- Major reengineered prediction system. Now predicts the future for all planets and does battle resolution on all planets at all turns
	- Can now predict future conquests/losses for any player
 * Attacker
	- All-out: Once started, the attack component will do nothing but all-out
	- All-out: Takes future enemy conquests into consideration (sniping)
	- All-out: Now takes future enemy production into account before launching
	- All-out: Is launched earlier since future enemy losses against neutrals is taken into account
	- When neither of the conditions for decimate/allout is triggered and there are no interesting neutrals we will all-out.
	- Production optimizer: Will no longer attack planets that we will own in the future
	- Production optimizer: Signals if there are still interesting neutral planets, but we just don't have enough forces to take them
 * Defender
	- 
	- 

20-10-2010 Version 1.3
--------------
 * Basic defence implemented
	If we at any point in the future will lose a planet then allied planets will try to assist if they can.
	Planets under attack will only send out fleets as long as the planet isn't captured as a result. (Budget is respected)
 * Basic routing implemented
	A frontline is computed. All non frontline planets will send supplies to the nearest frontline

01-10-2010 Version 1.2
--------------
 * Algorithm to increase production through conquest of neutral/enemy planets implemented.

30-09-2010 Version 1.1
--------------
 * Basic implementation of the model implemented. Now each component / part logic needs to be optimized
 * CoM algorithm changed to take fleets on the move into consideration
 * Added extra bonus for conquering enemy planets (compared to neutrals - since this effectively takes away enemy growth)

29-09-2010 Version 1.0
--------------
Basic outline for the logic laid out in code. Several implementations are missing. The bot can play though.
